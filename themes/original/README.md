Original Nesta theme
====================

This is a theme for the Nesta, a [Ruby CMS](nesta), designed by Graham Ashton.

[nesta]: http://effectif.com/nesta

It takes it's name from the fact that it was the default look and feel of Nesta when it first came out. The default markup and look has been updated since Nesta was first released. If you want to update the code but keep the old look, install this theme.

Installation
------------

From within your Nesta project, run:

    $ ./scripts/theme install git://github.com/gma/nesta-theme-original
