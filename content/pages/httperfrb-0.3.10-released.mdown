# HTTPerf.rb 0.3.10 Released

Adding `tee` support, which will print any httperf (both STDOUT and STDERR) output to STDOUT while running the process.

> Note: this only works with `HTTPerf#run` and not `HTTPerf#fork`.

### Example:

    :::ruby
    require 'httperf'
    perf = HTTPerf.new( "server" => "host", "port" => 8080, "uri" => "/foo", "tee" => true )
    output = perf.run
