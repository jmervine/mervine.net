# HTTPS: Creating Self-signed Certs

Occasionally, I need to create self-signed certs when testing application through https. This isn't really the best way to do it, as it will require anyone visiting to confirm a security exception, but it's useful in a pinch.

Here's the basics...

### Generate Key


    $ openssl genrsa -des3 -out cert.key 1024
    => enter password

### Generate CSR

    $ openssl req -new -key cert.key -out cert.csr
    Country Name (2 letter code) []:CA
    State or Province Name (full name) []:California
    Locality Name (eg, city) [Newbury]:Sunland
    Organization Name (eg, company) [My Company Ltd]:SomeCompant
    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
    Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:mervine.net
    Email Address []:joshua at mervine dot net
    Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
    to be sent with your certificate request
    A challenge password []:
    An optional company name []:

### Remove Key Password

    $ cp cert.key cert.key.org
    $ openssl rsa -in cert.key.org -out cert.key

### Generate Self-signed Cert

    $ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in cert.csr -signkey cert.key -out cert.crt

### Copy Files to Nginx Config

    $ sudo cp cert.crt /etc/nginx/
    $ sudo cp cert.key /etc/nginx/

### Nginx Config Example (from nginx default)

    $ sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

    server {
        listen       443;
        server_name  localhost;

        ssl                  on;
        ssl_certificate      cert.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key  cert.key;

        location / {
            root   html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }
    }
