### Simple Shell Unit Testing Framework: [odb/shunt](https://github.com/odb/shunt)

> For a recent project, I wanted a very simple way to run some simple tests against my script output. I know there are a number of these kinds of things out there, but most of the ones I looked at were more complex then I wanted. To start, I created a basic shell script to test my scripts, but as I began to add to it, and want more from it, I decided to take a few minutes and build a pseudo-framework out of it.

### Style Framework for The Terminal: [odb/shml](https://github.com/odb/shml)

> HTML has CSS, terminals have "ANSI/VT100 Control Sequences". SHML makes is easy to apply some style to your shell scripts without trying to remember that Yellow = \033[33m instead Yellow is $(color yellow).
