### Experience - Open Source (a.k.a Nights and Weekends)

Over the last few years, I've worked quite actively on several open source projects, some by contract and some just for fun. Aside from the highlighted projects below, have a ton of stuff on [Github](https://github.com/jmervine), as I use it as a bit of a scratch directory. For highlights and additional information on some of the other projects (gem's, npm's, etc.) I've created, see: [mervine.net/projects](http://mervine.net/projects).

#### BootstrapCDN

[BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) is an open source web site, focused on easily and reliabily deliever [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) client design framework to the public in a free and open source capacity. I work closely with the developers of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/), delivering updates and site enhancements as necessary.

#### Httperf Tools

[Httperf](http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/) is an open source C based performance testing tool. No I didn't write it. I do however maintain a fork and have written bindings and tools for it in several difference languages &ndash; see: [httperf.js](https://github.com/jmervine/httperfjs), [httperf.rb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/httperfrb), and [a few others on my Github](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Ajmervine+httperf).

#### MaxCDN Tools

I have written and maintain several libraries and tools for integration with [MaxCDN](http://www.maxcdn.com)'s OAuth API. This includes [MaxCLI](https://github.com/maxcdn/maxcli) (a suite of Golang based cross platform commandline utilies) and libraries for [Ruby](https://github.com/MaxCDN/ruby-maxcdn), [Python](https://github.com/MaxCDN/python-maxcdn), [Node.js](https://github.com/MaxCDN/node-maxcdn) and [Golang](https://github.com/MaxCDN/go-maxcdn).
