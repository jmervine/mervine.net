# Autoperf (w/ HTTPerf.rb)

Autoperf is a ruby driver for httperf, designed to help you automate load and performance
testing of any web application - for a single end point, or through log replay.

This has been refactored from the original -- https://github.com/igrigorik/autoperf --
to include [HTTPerf.rb](http://rubyops.net/gems/httperfrb) as a simplification.

To get started, first download & install httperf:

[http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/](http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/)

Or for HTTPerf.rb percentile support, install this fork:

[http://github.com/rubyops/httperf](http://github.com/rubyops/httperf)

Install Autoperf:

    gem install bundler
    echo 'gem "autoperf", :git => "git://github.com/jmervine/autoperf.git"' >> Gemfile
    bundle install

Or without bundler:

   git clone git://github.com/jmervine/autoperf.git
   cd autoperf
   gem build autoperf.gemspec
   gem install ./autoperf-VERSION.gem

Next, either run a simple test straight from the command line (man httperf), or create
an execution plan for autoperf. If you want to replay an access log from your production
environment, follow these steps:

    # grab last 10000 lines from nginx log, and extract a certain pattern (if needed)
    tail -n 10000 nginx.log | bundle exec make_replay_log > replay_log

Next, configure your execution plan (see sample.yml), and run autoperf:

    bundle exec autoperf -c sample.yml


Sample output:

If your server uses caching, making it pointless to run the same requests over
and over, you can use different requests for each run.

    # Create 10 1000-line files (xa, xb, xc etc)
    split -a 1 requests_path

    # Convert to null-terminated strings
    for x in x?; do tr "\n" "\0" < $x > $x.nul; done

    # run as before, but use the `wlog` line instead of `httperf_wlog` in the conf file
    autoperf -c sample.yml
