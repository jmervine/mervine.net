# Autobench [aplha release]

Autobench, as follow up to [Autoperf](http://mervine.net/gems/autoperf), was created to allow for benchmarking web pages 
in three different ways. 

1. Render Metrics -- using [`httperf`](http://mervine.net/httperf] and [`HTTPerf.rb`](http://mervine.net/gems/httperfrb], it 
   grabs a snapshot of how long it takes to access, (server side) render and download your page. You can set thresholds 
   in your configuration for almost all of httperf's output. Additionally, if you use 
   [my version of httperf](http://mervine.net/httperf-0-9-1-with-individual-connection-times) you'll get percentile
   support as well.
2. Client Metrics -- using [`phantomas`](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas), a sweet [PhantomJS](http://mervine.net/phantomjs)
   script that grabs all kinds of useful DOM information from loading your page. See `phantomas` for more details.
3. YSlow Metrics -- using [`yslow.js`](http://yslow.org/phantomjs), a [PhantomJS](http://mervine.net/phantomjs) script
   written to inspect your page and give you all kinds of useful grading and information. See [YSlow](http://yslow.org)
   for more details.
   
Autobench is based around a pass / fail mentality and let's you set as many or as few thresholds as you would like through
it's extensive, but hopefully simple configuration. You can easily generate a template configuration for your web page by
running `autobench-config -o ./path/to/write/config.yml -s example.com -u /path/to/page` (see usage notes below for details).

> For sample configurations, see: [github.com/jmervine/autobench/tree/master/config](https://github.com/jmervine/autobench/tree/master/config).

## Installation

    gem install autobench --pre

    # or...

    bundle init
    echo "gem 'autobench', '0.0.1alpha1'" >> Gemfile
    bundle install --path vendor/bundle

## Dependancies

The following three dependancies must either be in your PATH, or specified in your configuration like so:

    :::yaml
    paths:
        httperf: /path/to/httperf
        phantomjs: /path/to/phantomjs
        node: /path/to/node


#### HTTPerf

It's recommended that you install [my version of httperf](http://mervine.net/httperf-0-9-1-with-individual-connection-times),
however, if you choose not to, any version will give you most of the thresholds available.

    :::bash
    # Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install httperf
    
    # CentOS
    sudo yum install httperf
    
    # Mac
    sudo port install httperf # I think? Anyone, confirm!

#### PhantomJS

See: [phantomjs.org](http://phantomjs.org/).

#### NodeJS

See: [Installing Node.js from Source](/notes/installing-nodejs-from-source) or [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/).

## Usage

### With [Minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest)

    :::ruby
    require "minitest/autorun"
    require "autobench"

    class TestBenchmarks < Minitest::Test
        def setup
            @autobench = Autobench.new("./config/mervine.yml")
        end

        def test_autobench_render
            @autobench.render.benchmark
            assert @autobench.render.passed?,
                "Passed:\n#{@autobench.render.successes}\nFailed:\n#{@autobench.render.failures}"

        end

        def test_autobench_client
            @autobench.client.benchmark
            assert @autobench.client.passed?,
                "Passed:\n#{@autobench.client.successes}\nFailed:\n#{@autobench.client.failures}"
        end

        def test_autobench_yslow
            @autobench.yslow.benchmark
            assert @autobench.yslow.passed?,
                "Passed:\n#{@autobench.yslow.successes}\nFailed:\n#{@autobench.yslow.failures}"
        end
    end

#### `autobench-config`

The purpose of this is to generate a base configuration for your page, containing
all possible values in their current state.

> Note: I recommend looking over each configuration and removing those you don't
> care about. Also, you should bump most up just a bit to account for standard
> network variance.
