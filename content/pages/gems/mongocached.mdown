Title: Mongocached
Summary: Simple mongodb based cache for things like Sinatra and Rails which is implemented much like Memcached in hopes that in some cases they're interchangeable. It's based off 'diskcached'.
Categories: gems, mongo, ruby caching

# Mongocached

I created [Mongocached](http://mongocached.rubyops.net/), with help from [Hector Virgen](http://www.virgentech.com/), as a simple shared cacheing layer for things like html fragments and database calls as a follow up to [Diskcached](http://mongocached.rubyops.net/). It specifically targets situations where you want to cache large amounts of data and have memory constraints. 

### Installation

  :::shell
  gem install mongocached
	
*Or with Bundler:*

  :::ruby
	source :rubygems
	gem 'mongocached'

### Basic Usage

  :::ruby
	$cache = Mongocached.new()

	# with auth
	# $cache = Mongocached.new({ username: 'uname', password: 'pword' })

	# memcached style
	$cache.set('key', 'data')
	$cache.get('key')

	# block stlye
	$cache.save('key') do
		'data'
	end
