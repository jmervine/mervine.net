#VIM Tips and Tricks

These are basically my notes on [VIM], and some of the things I've found along the way. I expect that this will be something that continues to grow over time.

##My Setup

My setup is based on a forked version of [spf13](https://github.com/jmervine/spf13-vim) (from [spf13/spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim)). You can check it out here: [jmervine/vim-config](http://github.com/jmervine/vim-config).

##Amazing Plugins/Addon

[VIM] plugins/addons I can't live without.

* [gmarik/vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) - The missing [VIM] plugin manager.
* [mileszs/ack.vim](http://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim) - Ack for [VIM]
* [scrooloose/nerdtree](http://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) - Director and file drawer.
* [corntrace/bufexplorer](http://github.com/corntrace/bufexplorer) - Easy buffer switching.
* [tpope/vim-fugitive](http://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) - Everything you could ever want out of built in git handling and more.
* [mattn/webapi-vim](http://github.com/mattn/webapi-vim) - Required for `vim-fugitive`.
* [mattn/gist-vim](http://github.com/mattn/gist-vim) - Add, edit, delete gists from [VIM].
* [scrooloose/nerdcommenter](http://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter) - Commenting made easy.
* [tpope/vim-rails](http://github.com/tpope/vim-rails) - Ruby/Rails stuff.


##Code Samples

####Disable mouse mode when not in `gvim`:

    " turn off mouse mode
    if !has('gui')
        set mouse-=a
    end


####Trailing whitespace handling:

    " for use before a colorscheme definition
    autocmd ColorScheme * highlight ExtraWhitespace ctermbg=red guibg=red

    " for use when not using a colorscheme
    " highlight ExtraWhitespace ctermbg=red guibg=red

    " show unwanted whitespace
    match ExtraWhitespace /\s\+\%#\@<!$/

    " strip unwanted trailing whitespace on save
    autocmd BufWritePre * :%s/\s\+$//e


####Toggle spell checking:

    " toggle spell checking
    imap <Leader>s <C-o>:setlocal spell! spelllang=en_gb<CR>
    nmap <Leader>s :setlocal spell! spelllang=en_gb<CR>


####Tab handling for various file types:

    augroup myfiletypes
      " Clear old autocmds in group
      autocmd!

      " autoindent with two spaces, always expand tabs
      autocmd FileType * set ai sw=2 sts=2 et

      " autoindent with four spaces, always expand tabs
      " when working in:
      " - python
      " - html
      " - xml
      " - markdown
      autocmd FileType python,html,xml,markdown set ai sw=4 sts=4 et
    augroup END

[VIM]: /vim "VIM"
